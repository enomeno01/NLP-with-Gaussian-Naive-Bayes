# NLP-with-Gaussian-Naive-Bayes
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to a customer reviews dataset, using a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to perform sentiment analysis. The text data is cleaned through processes such as lowercasing, punctuation and stopword removal, and lemmatization. After transforming the text into numerical features using CountVectorizer, the model is trained and tested, achieving an accuracy score of 0.69. The project also includes a frequency analysis of the most common words in the reviews, visualized with a bar chart, offering insights into the dominant themes expressed by customers.
